## How to use
Make sure NodeJS is installed

- `npm i`

- Edit the `config.json` to change the default value

- run `npm run start` to run the script

- It will ask for input and output folder. Enter your desired path. If you want the default path set in config just press enter

You can put multiple videos in the input folder.
